# Data-Structure
For this project implementation we have chosen a premise where tasks are scheduled for execution and the relevant data needs to be stored and analyzed further. To implement this project we will use concepts such as searching, sorting, linked lists.

Assume a scenario in which you are receiving data for each task that includes task_id,
start_time and end_time. start_time and end_time are available in equivalent integer format.
Each of these data points need to be stored in a node that will have three values. Once the data
points are available and stored in the linked list we will perform analysis based on the data
points that are stored in the linked list.
